  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/ # fire
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    - assets/images/default_avatar.png
    - assets/images/home_icon.png
    - assets/images/CacaliaLoginHeader.png
    - assets/images/CacaliaSignin.png
    - assets/images/CreatePass.png
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/designs/
    - assets/images/designCircles/
    # - assets/images/default_avatar.png

    # - assets/images/CacaliaLoginHeader.png
    # - assets/images/CacaliaSignin.png
    # - assets/images/CreatePass.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: DotGothic16
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/DotGothic16-Regular.ttf
    - family: ArchitectsDaughter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ArchitectsDaughter-Regular.ttf
    - family: Anton
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Anton-Regular.ttf
    - family: Lobster
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lobster-Regular.ttf
    - family: PirataOne
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/PirataOne-Regular.ttf
